	<h3> Purpose </h3>
		<p> The purpose of this applet is to provide the minimum required
			sample size or power of a SMART (Sequential Multiple Assignment
			Randomized Trial) with one of a variety of primary aims.</p>

	<h3> Notation and Assumptions </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> <img src="images/randomize.gif" width=25> refers to
			 randomization. We allow randomization in each stage to among 2 and 5 intervention options.</li>
			<li> Adaptive interventions (AIs) are denoted by the combination
				 of the letters of the interventions provided. The first letter
				 indicates the first-stage treatment, the second, the
				 second-stage option for those who respond, and the third, the
				 the option for those who do not respond. For example, {A,C,E}
				 denotes the AI which reads as ''First receive A and if there
				 is a response, receive C; if there is no response, receive
				 E. </li>
			<li> For more details on the assumptions behind the sample size
				 calculations, please refer to Kidwell et al.
				 (2017) and Oetting et al. (2007). </li>
		</ul>

	<h3> Methods </h3>
		<p> For binary outcomes, sample size is computed according to the
			methods presented in Kidwell et al. (2017). </p>
		<p> For continuous outcomes, sample size is computed according to the
			 methods in Oetting et al. (2007). </p>
		<p> The application is run on <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>
			version <span class="Rversion"></span>, and written using
			<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Shiny</a>, an open-source web
			 application framework for R produced by
			 <a href="http://www.rstudio.com" target="_blank">RStudio</a>. </p>
