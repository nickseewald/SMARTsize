		We consider a trial on adaptive pharmacological and behavioral treatments for children with ADHD (W. Pelham, P.I.). 
	  </p>
	  <h4> Motivation </h4>
	  <p>
		A number of efficacious pharmacological and behavioral interventions are available for the treatment of ADHD.
		However, it is unclear whether the first-stage treatment should be pharmacological or behavioral. 
	  </p>
	  <h4> Trial Components </h4>
		There are four treatments under study. They are
		<ol>
			<li> Low- and high-dose methylphenidate (a psychostimulant) (MEDS)
			<li> Low- and high-intensity behavioral modification (BMOD)
		</ol>
			The tailoring variable used were scores on the Impairment Rating Scale (IRS) and an individualized test of target 
			behaviors (ITB); both are well-known instruments which assess response to treatment.

	  <h4> Embdedded Adaptive Interventions </h4>
			There are four adaptive interventions embedded in this design, as pictured above. They are
			<ol>
				<li> "Give low-intensity BMOD. If the child responds to treatment, continue providing low-intensity BMOD. Otherwise, if the child does not respond, 
				augment low-intensity BMOD with MEDS."
				<li> "Give low-intensity BMOD. If the child responds to treatment, continue providing low-intensity BMOD. Otherwise, if the child does not respond, 
				switch to high-intensity BMOD."
				<li> "Give low-dose MEDS. If the child responds to treatment, continue providing low-dose MEDS. Otherwise, if the child does not respond,
				augment low-dose MEDS with BMOD."
				<li> "Give low-dose MEDS. If the child responds to treatment, continue providing low-dose MEDS. Otherwise, if the child does not respond,
				switch to high-dose MEDS."
			</ol>
		<h4>Outcome Measures</h4>
			Outcome measures include time-varying ratings of child behavior (from parents and teachers) as well as final IRS and ITB scores after 8 months.
