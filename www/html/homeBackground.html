<h2> Background </h2>

<p>An <strong>adaptive intervention</strong> (AI, also known as a dynamic treatment regime, treatment algorithm, adaptive treatment strategy) leads to a sequence of treatments or interventions tailored to an individual. For example, an AI in the treatment of autism may be '''First treat the child using joint attention symbolic play engagement and regulation therapy along with enhanced milieu training for 12 weeks. If the child responds (25% or more improvement on 7 or more of 14 measures of communication) then continue the same treatment for an additional 12 weeks. If the child does not respond at the end of 12 weeks, then continue the same treatment with the addition of a speech generating device. </p>
                        
<p>AIs contain three pieces: critical decisions which include treatment options, tailoring variables to decide how to adapt the treatments, and decision rules which input previous treatments and tailoring variables and output recommended subsequent treatment. The example AI in the treatment of autism includes decisions as to the best initial and second-line therapy for children, with treatment options including types of therapy and a speech generating device, the tailoring variable includes response defined as meeting a threshold on various communication tests, and, depending on response, subsequent treatment differs. </p>
                        
<p>A <strong>tailoring variable</strong> is a personal characteristic (fixed or time-varying) that can be used to personalize treatment to an individual. For more information about tailoring variables, see Nahum-Shani et al. (2012). In the SMART designs above, we assume the tailoring variable is response, but your definition may vary (for example, adherent/non-adherent, engage/non-engage). Also note that in Designs II and III, non-responders are re-randomized, while responders are not. It is possible to switch this notation so that only responders would be randomized and non-responders would not. If this is the case, please provide the ''non-response probability'' when prompted for ''response probability''.</p>
                        
<p>A <strong>Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART)</strong> is used to develop effective AIs. A SMART is an experimental design in which some or all individuals are randomized multiple times to follow specific intervention sequences. We depict the three most common SMART designs above. In the depictions above, each treatment at each stage is assigned a unique letter. It is not, however, necessary for all treatments to be unique. For example, in Design A, treatments C and G may be the same and/or D and H may be the same. </p>
                        
<p>The primary aim of a SMART may be the comparison of main effects (first or second-stage treatments), comparison of AIs, or further tailoring of AIs. This applet is designed for the primary aim of comparing AIs. Specifically, this applet calculates the minimum required sample size or power for a SMART where the primary interest is in comparing two AIs where the primary outcome of the trial is continuous or binary. If instead interest is in computing the sample size for a SMART with a survival outcome, please see <a href="http://methodologymedia.psu.edu/logranktest/samplesize" target="_blank">http://methodologymedia.psu.edu/logranktest/samplesize</a> or <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~wahed/Research/Resources/" target="_blank">  http://www.pitt.edu/~wahed/Research/Resources/</a>.
